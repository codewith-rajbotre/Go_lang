Slices are dynamic – Unlike arrays, slices can grow and shrink.
✅ Uses an underlying array – Modifying a slice may modify the original array.
✅ Use append() to add elements – Can also append another slice.
✅ Use copy() to create a new independent slice.
✅ Use slicing syntax (slice[start:end]) – Useful for creating sub-slices.
✅ Capacity (cap()) matters – Helps optimize memory usage.
